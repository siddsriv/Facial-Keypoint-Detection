## Background
Facial Keypoint detection or Landmark detection implies identifying the various keypoints present on any face. In each training and test image, there is a single face and **68 keypoints, with coordinates (x, y), for that face**.  These keypoints mark important areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc. These keypoints are relevant for a variety of tasks, such as face filters, emotion recognition, pose recognition, and so on. Here they are, numbered, and you can see that specific ranges of points match different portions of the face.
